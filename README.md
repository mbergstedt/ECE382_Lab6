===========
##PWM - "Robot Motion"
###Purpose
Gain experience using the pulse-width modulation features of the MSP430.
###Preliminary Design
My flowchart for the required functionality is:

Some psuedocode I had for required functionality is:

When I tried to implement the ir sensor, I needed to go back to get some values from my remote using code from Lab 4, but I was never able to get that to work.  Therefore, I did not adjust my designs to account for the ir sensor.
###Hardware Design
My hardware design for required functionality is:

My actual hardware setup is:

###Debugging

###Testing Methodology/Results

###Observations/Conclusions

###Documentation
Dr Coulston helped explain how to do the setup to allow for the motor to go either forwards or backwards.
